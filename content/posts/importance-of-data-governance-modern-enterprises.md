## 1. Data Quality and Consistency

Data governance establishes processes to maintain data quality and consistency across different systems and departments, leading to more reliable insights and decision-making.

## 2. Regulatory Compliance

With increasing data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA, robust data governance helps organizations meet compliance requirements and avoid costly penalties.

High-quality, well-governed data leads to more accurate analytics and reporting, enabling better-informed business decisions.

Effective data governance reduces data silos and improves data accessibility, leading to increased operational efficiency and productivity.
